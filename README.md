## Instructions on how to build and run:
- Download all files in this repo and place them inside a new directory of your choice. Ideally use `git init` and follow the standard github procedure for setting up a new repository first: https://github.com/new
- Start here: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
- Windows: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ contains the latest version of Node.js downloader. You will need this installed to install "npm" - the package manager essential for Vite or other frameworks
- Linux: similar process, but slightly different recommended defaults (seen in first docs page link)
- Run `npm install -g npm` in a default command line and, once inside the root of the project, run `npm install -g vite`, as well as `npm install bootstrap` (for framework and additional styling)
- Hopefully the packages and such included in my code will adequately detect and install dependencies, and be deployable as-is. Some of these commands may not be necessary.
- `npm run dev` opens the project in localhost to edit live anywhere, while `npm run deploy` deploys the website to the associated url

## Outside resources used:
- Bootstrap docs: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3 (navbar, experimenting with carousel, accordion, and more - very helpful examples and documentation here)
- MDN Web docs by Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ - extremely thorough documentation on pretty much every css, html, and javascript goody you can possibly think of. Seriously great resource
- Vite docs: https://vite.dev/guide/ - not as great as MDN web docs for example, but a decent, though convoluted at times, resource for configuring vite setup and deployment
- CSS Examples and templates: https://getcssscan.com/ - nicely laid out examples for different effects and such
