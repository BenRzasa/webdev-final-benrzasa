                <p>Hey! I'm Ben Rzasa, a PSU Computer Science undergrad, mediocre programmer, and enjoyer of video games. This website showcases some basic web development skills I've learned in the past year, as well as my work experience, projects I'm especially proud of, and a way to contact me.  I always enjoy learning new topics related to CS, new languages, frameworks, operating systems, whatever gets my interest at a certain moment. May not have professional experience in any CS industry or be set up for a good internships like some of my peers, but I attempt to make up for it with genuine interest and willingness to try new projects.</p>

                <h1>Previous Work / CS Skills</h1>
                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web development - been working on a community tool for a game I play, used by a majority of the active players now, since March 2025, with over 500 documented commits and deploys from github: "Zenith's Trading Tool," seen in the Projects section on this page. Experience creating multi-page static sites, less so with backend operations, although I have done some with the very basics.</li>
                    <li>Languages (In order of most to least experience): JavaScript, C++, C, HTML, CSS, NASM, a smattering of Lua</li>
                    <li>Proficient in VIM/VI/NeoVim text editors - enables quick editing of code and construction of projects</li>
                    <li>Proficient in Linux usage, navigation, commands, and basic scripting - even took the dive and dual booted Arch on my laptop's 2nd SSD! That was quite the endeavor...</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Work (Ordered from most to least recent)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unfortunately, haven't had much luck looking for or applying to CS internships. Attempting to branch out and focus more specifically on Web Development (Primarily frontend and UI design, as I genuinely really enjoy tinkering with website UI and functionality).</li>
                    <li>Currently employed at the PSU Library - Circ desk, stacks, assistance, etc.</li>
                    <li>Summer 2024 - Worked at the Johnson County Library in Buffalo, Wyoming. Ran the front desk, shelved, helped patrons with technical and other library questions, took calls, and created re-usable media for library promotional material.</li>
                    <li>Summer 2023 - Employed in Sheridan County School District #2's groundskeeping team. Operated heavy mowing equipment, on a 6am-2pm shift. Would not recommend, especially being a 35 minute drive away at the time.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p><strong>"Zenith's Trading Tool" (ZTT)</strong><br>My largest and most involved project to date, with over 500 commits and 800 deployments to github-pages. Website side project programmed in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, using the React framework for functionality, and Vite to package and deploy the site. Been under development since March 2025, and continues to be extremely fun to work on. Allows users to copy their inventory CSV string from the game "Celestial Caverns", load it in, and view and modify various statistics. Includes a trade tool, value chart, navigation bar, fully custom UI, background image/gif storing and optimization via a basic database, and much more. Even recently implemented data fetching from a wiki page via their API, after learning about it in this class! Very proud of this project overall, it's even being actively used by a majority of active players.</p>
